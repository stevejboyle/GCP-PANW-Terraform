# Terraform VM-Series Deployment — Best Practices

This document summarizes key best practices implemented in this repo for production-grade Terraform workflows.

---

## ✅ Code Structure

- Modularized reusable VM logic (`modules/vmseries`)
- Environment-specific configuration under `environments/{env}/{instance}`
- Automation scripts kept separate (`automation-scripts/`)
- All variables strictly validated using `variables.tf`

---

## ✅ Secrets & SSH Keys

- No hardcoded SSH keys in any tfvars or variables files
- SSH key loaded dynamically using `locals {}` inside `main.tf`:
  ```hcl
  locals {
    ssh_key_content = file("${path.root}/../../../../gcp.key.pub")
    ssh_public_keys = ["admin:${local.ssh_key_content} admin"]
  }
  ```
- SSH keys read at runtime only, not stored in repo

---

## ✅ Parser-Safe tfvars

- Only pure HCL used inside `terraform.tfvars` files
- No function calls inside tfvars (compliant with Terraform parser)

---

## ✅ Metadata Injection

- Metadata block flattened for simplicity:
  ```hcl
  metadata = {
    mgmt-interface-swap    = "enable"
    serial-port-enable     = "true"
    ssh-keys               = join("\n", var.ssh_public_keys)
    block-project-ssh-keys = "true"
  }
  ```

---

## ✅ Automation & Repeatability

- Makefile simplifies repeatable init/apply/validate/destroy tasks
- `create_instance.sh` script supports rapid environment cloning
- Validation script (`validate.sh`) included for pre-deployment checks

---

## ✅ Git Hygiene

- `gcp.key.pub` excluded from Git — must exist at runtime
- Repo safe for public or private Git repositories
- Fully safe to push to GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

---

## ✅ Release Management

- `RELEASE_TAG_CHECKLIST.md` included for official tagging workflow
- Semantic versioning recommended (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc)

---

## ✅ Audit & Hand-off Documentation

- `README.md` usage guide
- `PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md` for operations handoff
- `REPO_ARCHITECTURE.md` for repo structure documentation
- `REPO_STRUCTURE_RECOMMENDATION.md` for team adoption

---

## ✅ Summary

> This repo fully implements production-grade Terraform patterns for real-world multi-instance VM deployments on GCP, with strong compliance, security, and team onboarding support.
